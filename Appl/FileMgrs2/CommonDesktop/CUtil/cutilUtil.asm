COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		UtilAddToFileChangeList
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Add the object to the system-level file-change notification
		list, as well as the application object's active list, so
		we can remove it from the file-change list on detach.

CALLED BY:	(EXTERNAL) FolderScan, Tree...
PASS:		*ds:si	= object
RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	ax, bx, cx, dx, di
SIDE EFFECTS:	object is added to both the GCNSLT_FILE_SYSTEM list and the
     		application object's active list. object will want to handle
		MSG_META_DETACH and call UtilRemoveFromFileChangeList

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		CompareDiskHandles
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	See if two disk handles are "the same", for the purposes
		of quick-transfer and determining what the default
		quick-transfer action should be.

CALLED BY:	GetQuickTransferMethod, various DeskDisplay tools
PASS:		ax	= disk handle #1
		dx	= disk handle #2
RETURN:		flags set so je will take if two disks are "the same"
DESTROYED:	ax, dx

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		While the comparison of disk handles would appear fairly
		simple, it is complicated by the existence of StandardPath
		constants. For our purposes, if both ax and dx are StandardPath
		constants, they're "the same". If one is a StandardPath and
		the other is the system disk, the are also "the same". If
		ax and dx are numerically the same, they are also "the same"

	; set to a common directory, it's possible that the directory
	; will be nuked by another user, in which case NETX drops that
	; drive entirely, causing all kinds of problems.  Doing a
	; FilePopDir doesn't solve this, as it doesn't actually
	; communicate that we no longer need that directory to NETX
	; (maybe it should).  The only fix is to set the CWD to
	; something else, which is a total hack, and is certainly only
	; going to solve the problem in a very small number of cases,
	; but this case is probably the only one the testers will

	; penalty for the opening of every folder, but it's rather

; For each NewDeskObjectType, there are 2 blocks of UI that are
; duplicated -- one for each thread.  Below are tables that match the
; NewDeskObjectType to the handle of the template block to be
; duplicated.  Note that the offsets of the Folder and GenView objects
; within each template must be identical.
;
;	The tables are laid out with the BA items first, as the BA
; enumerated types start from a fixed negative such that they end at -2.
; The NewDesk items begin with 0 and grow up from there.  This was done to
; allow either NewDesk or BA to gain WOT's without changing any of the
; existing WOT's stored on disk in links.  When adding BA WOT's, add them
; to the negative end of the list, when adding NewDesk WOT's add them to
; the end of the enumerated type.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;
; This is the table of template folder objects.  There must be one for
; each NewDeskObjectType, and the offsets of each must be the same.
