# Token: The four-letter name is used by GeoManager to locate the
# icon for this application in the token database. The tokenid
# number corresponds to the manufacturer ID of the program's author
# for uniqueness of the token. Since this is a sample application, we
# use the manufacturer ID for the SDK, which is 8.

# Heapspace: This is roughly the non-discardable memory usage (in words)
# of the application and any transient libraries that it depends on,
# plus an additional amount for thread activity. To find the heapspace
# for an application, use the Swat "heapspace" command.

# Resources: list all resource blocks which are used by the application.

#
# For this application, as for most, we want a UI thread to run the
# object resources, so we mark them "ui-object". Had we wanted the
# application thread to run them, we would have marked them "object".
