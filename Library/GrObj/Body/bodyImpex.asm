; This constant is used to prevent the user from creating a bitmap which is
; too big to store.  There is an EC check on the size of a chunk array
; element and this should prevent the user from making that too big.  In
; non-EC, the user may run out of memory if the bitmap is too big.  The
; units for this constant are points, and this gives the user a 12-inch
; wide bitmap.  Since the default bitmap is 4-bit 72dpi, this will not
; violate the EC check.  Also, if the user were to change the resolution of
; a 12-inch bitmap to 600dpi, the EC check will not fail because the chunk
; array element size will still be small enough.  --JimG 6/14/94

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Description:	Does the "real" work of pasting a CIF_GRAPHICS_STRING format
		transfer, reading the item and creating a gstring object with
		the passed gstring, then adding the object to the body.

Pass:		*ds:si = GrObjBody
		bx - VM file
		ax - block handle

		cx, dx - extra data (presumably width, height)

Return:		nothing

Destroyed:	nothing
