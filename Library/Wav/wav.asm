SYNOPSIS:	Plays a sound specified in the ini file.

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL
PASS:		cx:dx = vfptr to GeodeToken
		bx - enumerated type

RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:

 To call this function, you need to make sure the wav file is pointed by a key
 under [sound] category.  The key is composed of the GeodeToken of the calling
 app, and an enumerated word value defined by the app.  For example, the Tetris
 game plays a wav file for dropping pieces.  In tetris, the code calls this
 WavPlayInitSound with Tetris GeodeToken and a word value defined by Tetris.

	#define TETRIS_DROP_SOUND   0
	#define TETRIS_ROTATE_SOUND 1
	GeodeToken token;
	GeodeGetInfo(GeodeGetCodeProcessHandle(), GGIT_TOKEN_ID, &token);
	WavPlayInitSound(&token, TETRIS_DROP_SOUND);
	WavPlayInitSound(&token, TETRIS_ROTATE_SOUND);

 In the net.ini file, you specifed the wav file associate with the sound by:

	[sound]
	84_69_84_82_0_0 = drop.wav
	84_69_84_82_0_1 = rotate.wav

 where "84_69_84_82" is the ascii decimal value of "TETR", the 4 letter token
 chars of the app, the second last digit is the manufacutre ID of Tetris.
 (MANUFACTURE_ID_GEOWORKS is 0.)  The last digit is the enumerated word value
 defined by the app.
