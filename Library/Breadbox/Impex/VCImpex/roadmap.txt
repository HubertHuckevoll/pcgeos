Rectangles
GR_DRAW_RECT, GR_DRAW_RECT_TO
GR_FILL_RECT, GR_FILL_RECT_TO

Ref: CInclude/gstring.h:651, 823, 663, 788, 1252, 1294

Curves & Splines
Cubic Bezier: GR_DRAW_CURVE, GR_DRAW_CURVE_TO, GR_DRAW_REL_CURVE_TO
Splines: GR_DRAW_SPLINE, GR_DRAW_SPLINE_TO
Ref: CInclude/gstring.h:680, 697, 712, 727, 735

Paths (path building/stroking/filling)
Path scope: GR_BEGIN_PATH, GR_END_PATH, GR_CLOSE_SUB_PATH, GR_SET_NULL_PATH
Stroke/fill/clip path: GR_DRAW_PATH, GR_SET_STROKE_PATH, GR_FILL_PATH, GR_SET_CLIP_PATH, GR_SET_WIN_CLIP_PATH
Moves for path: GR_MOVE_TO, GR_REL_MOVE_TO, GR_MOVE_TO_WWFIXED
Ref: CInclude/gstring.h:1189, 1214, 1220, 1226, 1240, 1246, 1232, 1198, 1206, 908, 917, 927

Arcs:
GR_DRAW_ARC: use <path> with an elliptical-arc segment; honor ArcCloseType (open chord, sector, etc.).
3‑point arcs: compute arc parameters from three points and emit a single SVG arc segment.
Curves: GR_DRAW_CURVE* → <path> cubic “C/S” segments.
Splines: convert to equivalent cubic Beziers or approximate with a polyline.
Brush polyline: approximate with stroke + caps/joins or SVG markers; exact brush stamping may require <marker> or pattern tiling.
