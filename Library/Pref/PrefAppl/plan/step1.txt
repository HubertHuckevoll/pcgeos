GOAL:
Create a new Preferences module geode named PrefAppl under Library/Pref/PrefAppl/ implemented in GOC, containing UI + required framework scaffolding. No real functionality is required yet beyond stub handlers needed for compilation.

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS (copy patterns, not logic):
Primary inspiration: Library/Pref/Prefsndn/ (structure, .gp style, resource layout, object naming patterns).

Tab wiring example: SDK_C/Tabs/tabs.goc (how the tab selector and the tab content interaction are connected; replicate the event wiring even though we have one tab).

DELIVERABLES (create these files/folders):
pcgeos/Library/Pref/PrefAppl/prefappl.gp
pcgeos/Library/Pref/PrefAppl/prefappl.goc
pcgeos/Library/Pref/PrefAppl/Art/moniker.goh (copy from Library/Pref/Prefsndn/Art/moniker.goh verbatim for now).
pcgeos/Library/Pref/PrefAppl/local.mk
pcgeos/Library/Pref/PrefAppl/prefappl.rev

BUILD TARGET / NON-GOALS:
Compile: cd to "~/pcgeos/Installed/Library/Pref/PrefAppl" (create if non-existent) and call
~/pcgeos-tools/shiny.sh.
No integration into the Preferences app selector/menu is required in this task.

UI SPEC (object tree + layout):
Top-level
        Include a tab selector implemented as a horizontally aligned GenItemGroupClass:
        Has HINT_ITEM_GROUP_TAB_STYLE
        Contains exactly one GenItemClass child
        That item’s moniker text: “Ensemble Apps”

This item group drives a TabGroup GenInteraction that contains the main content.

Tab content container: A TabGroup GenInteraction holds the content for tabs (only one tab for now).

Wire up tab switching events. Look at the Library/Pref/ConfigUI Pref sample for how tabs are set up in a Pref context.

Content layout inside the single tab page: Inside the single tab page (a child interaction/container of the TabGroup):
        Main horizontal row container
        A container oriented horizontally that holds:
                Left: a GenDynamicList
                Right: an interaction holding vertically stacked triggers

(1) GenDynamicList requirements
Must be sized to show 12 visible rows.
Must be wide enough for: A GEOS file name up to 32 chars.
If exact sizing hints are tricky, use the same sizing strategy used in existing pref modules / the Tabs sample (e.g., minimum size hints).

Dynamic list plumbing (stubs are fine)
Implement the callbacks/handlers that are required for a GenDynamicList to compile and run without missing symbols. Ensure the list’s item class/template is set appropriately per GEOS conventions (see pcgeos/Appl/SDK_C/GenDList/gendlist.goc). Be inspired by the Library/Pref/Prefbg pref module (although that is an asm module and uses a PrefDynamicList but this is almost the same) to see how messages should be named and to which object they should be delivered. There should be no initial selection and the list must allow multiple selections.

(2) Right-side button column
A GenInteraction acting as a holder for a vertical list of equally sized GenTriggers.
For now, include exactly one trigger:
Moniker: “Rescan”
Action: stub method handler (no real work).

IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS / CONVENTIONS:
Keep file/module naming consistent with repo rules.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (“DONE WHEN”):
Running the standard build for this module produces the geode successfully. shiny.sh must run without error.

The UI resources and object tree exist and are wired:
Tab-style GenItemGroup with one item “Ensemble Apps”
TabGroup interaction connected to that selector (per Tabs sample wiring)
Tab page contains the horizontal layout: dynamic list on left, vertical trigger column on right
Rescan trigger exists and compiles with a stub handler

EXTRA:
Add a comment block at the top of prefappl.goc in the usual PC/GEOS style.
