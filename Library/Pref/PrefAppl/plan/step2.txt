GOAL: make AppList in PrefAppl show all the apps in the SP/DISTAPPL folder and mark
applications selected that have one or more link(s) in the SP_APPLICATION and/or
SP_TOP/DESKTOP folders.

STRATEGY:
On starting up, scan the SP_SYS_APPLICATION/DISTAPPL data directory for Geodes of
type GEOS application. Create a list of the Geode names and tokens in an LMem ChunkArray.
Assume that there will be no subdirectorys.

Afterwards, scan the SP_APPLICATION folder and the SP_TOP/DESKTOP folder. In these folders
and their subfolders we are looking for links to applications only. Store each link to an
application that you can find in a separate ChunkArray. Store the StandardPath handle as well,
together with the relative path of the application.

In the next step, go thru the list of applications from DISTAPPL and for each app, scan the
SP_APPLICATION and the SP_TOP/DESKTOP list for links to that application. If a link is found,
stop the search and mark that app in the DISTAPPL list as selected.

The list of applications in DISTAPPL mmust be populated with the correct information. This list
can now be used to provide the monikers for our AppList UI gadget. If an app is selected in
DISTAPPL, it must also be selected in the AppList UI gadget.

DONE WHEN: We can be sure that the list of applications in DISTAPPL is correctly populated
and displayed in the AppList UI widgetry.

DESIGN: create a robust and reusable helper function for enumerating the DISTAPPL, SP_APPLICATION
and SP_TOP/DESKTOP folders which scans either for application geodes or links to
application geodes. Make sure to use LMem ChunkArray functions for memory management and don't
forget the usual GEOS drill of MemLock/MemUnlock.

API: use FileEnum for enumerating DISTAPPL, SP_APPLICATION and SP_TOP/DESKTOP folders.
