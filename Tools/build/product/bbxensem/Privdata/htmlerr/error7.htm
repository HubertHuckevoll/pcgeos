            <p>The web page you have requested can&#8217;t be contacted, because 
your computer is not connected to a telephone line, or there is a problem 
with your modem or with the telephone line.</p>
            <p>To solve this, try these steps (you may want to write these 
steps down or print this page):</p>
            </font></center>
            <font face="arial" size="3" color="#ffffff"><left>
            <p>1. Make sure your computer is connected to the telephone line. 
               </p>
            <p>2. Make sure your modem is still connected to your ISP.  Try
clicking &#8220;Reload&#8221; in the "View" menu, so the computer connects to the Internet
again.</p>
            <p>3. If you are connected but you still receive this message,
exit Ensemble, turn the computer off, wait for a second, and then turn the
computer on again.</p>
            <p>4. While the computer is restarting, check the telephone line 
with a regular telephone to make sure it is still working properly. If you 
can hear a dial tone and dial a number, it is working correctly.</p>
            <p>5. After the computer starts up, try connecting to the Internet 
again using WebMagick.</p>
