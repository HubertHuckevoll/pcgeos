                      The web page you have requested can't be contacted, because
                      your computer is not connected to a telephone line, or there is a problem
                      with your modem or with the telephone line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To solve this, try these steps (you may want to write these
                      steps down or print this page):
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      1. Make sure your computer is connected to the telephone line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      2. Make sure your modem is still connected to your ISP. Try
                      clicking "Reload" in the "View" menu, so the computer connects to the Internet
                      again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      3. If you are connected but you still receive this message,
                      exit Ensemble, turn the computer off, wait for a second, and then turn the
                      computer on again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      4. While the computer is restarting, check the telephone line
                      with a regular telephone to make sure it is still working properly. If you
                      can hear a dial tone and dial a number, it is working correctly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      5. After the computer starts up, try connecting to the Internet
                      again using WebMagick.
