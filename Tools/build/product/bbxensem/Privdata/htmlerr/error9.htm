      <p>The host computer containing this web page has been found, but can’t be contacted. That computer may have been turned off, or it may have been too busy to send you the web page you requested.</p>
                <p>Try clicking “Reload” in the &quot;View&quot; menu to see if 
                  the host computer will send you the page (sometimes it’s just 
                  a matter of timing to get your request for the web page to the 
                  host computer at the right moment).</p>
      <p>If you keep getting this message instead, you will probably have to wait until later, when the host computer is turned back on or becomes less busy.</p>
